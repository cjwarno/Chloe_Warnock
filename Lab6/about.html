                <li>Cruiser</li>
            </ul>
                    <p>The cruiser was designed for cruising, hence, how it got its name. It typically has a little lower seat height, making it a good “cruising” around-town motorcycle, but with a little added luggage, it can make a good weekend rider. The engine sizes again are pretty varied from a small displacement engine through 1,000cc or more depending on the brand. You may feel more like you’re sitting in a cruiser than on it, but it’s a great option for both new and experienced riders. When you imagine a cruiser (specifically a chopper), Harley-Davidson may be the first brand that comes to mind. We recommend looking at the H-D Low Rider for a good example of a cruiser. It’s a low slung motorcycle that can travel for miles and has a lot of accessories to make it a great motorcycle for a quick trip or a good weekend out on the road.</p>

                <li>Dual-Sport</li>
            </ul>
                    <p>Dual Sports are meant to go anywhere and doing anything. They bring the road features of lights and a horn but have more aggressive off-road suspension and possible knobby off-road tires. The seat height is generally a little taller to navigate the backroads and off beaten paths you can find on the backroads. They typically have limited storage options from the dealership, but can be outfitted with a number of extra bags to carry quite a bit of gear for a good weekend camping adventure. The KTM 1090 Adventure R mixes off-road capability with sporty looks and feel that can do anything. It has a higher seat height but doesn’t have too much power to make it a handful for a weekend ride. If you want to go on a long cruise, it can do that also. Outfit it with all the gear you need to make a few lasting memories.</p>

            </ul>
                    <p>Off-road motorcycles are exactly what they sound like: for going where no man has been before. They have taller seat heights to accommodate deeper brush and high suspension that can handle a few bumps along the way. They won’t typically have any lights or turn signals, so they will probably be trailered to the weekend riding spot. Most are pretty lightweight and ready to ride the back trails all weekend. Kawasaki makes a good lineup for off-road motorcycles that don’t break the bank. The KLX110 offers a 4-speed transmission with a clutch-less design that will make it easy on the hand and wrist all weekend for climbing those steep hills to check out the view.</p>

            <h3>Motorcycle Gear</h3>
                <p>Good motorcycle gear helps protect you from sun, rain, wind, noise, and debris, as well as pavement. It’s designed for more than just crash protection: it’s your second skin and protects you from sunburn, deafness from the wind, and anything that is flying through the air.

                    Crash protection is the biggest benefit, however, and those of us who have come into contact with the pavement and have been saved by our gear will tell you: it is better to have it and not need it. The human body does not do well when it encounters a sudden stop from speed. Remember falling down from a running speed as a kid? Remember the bloody knees and palms, and the torn jeans? Think about how fast you were going at the time, and remember that even short trips on a motorcycle will exceed that by several orders of magnitude.
                    
                    At speed, the road surface is a really big belt sander. Good gear is designed for abrasion resistance and is armored against impacts at your joints. Staying off that belt sander isn’t always an option, so good protection is the right way to go.</p>
      
            <h4>Helmets, Jackets, Boots, Gloves, Suits, Pants, and Armor</h4>
                <p>Riding a motorcycle exposes you to extreme risk, variations in weather, and requires your full concentration and physical ability. Luckily, motorcycle gear is available that can keep you safe in a crash, comfortable in any weather condition, and reduce fatigue. It should be considered a necessity when riding a motorcycle. Factor its cost into the overall price of purchasing a bike. There’s no such thing as not being able to afford good gear; reduce the price of the bike you’re buying until you can afford to buy the helmet, jacket, gloves, pants, and boots necessary to ride it.</p>
