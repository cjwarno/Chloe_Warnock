                <h1>Welcome to N. Sanity Island</h1>
                
                <p>N. Sanity Island is the first of the three islands in a small collection of islands near the eastern coast of Australia, sometimes called the Tasmanian Islands. The island is a tropical paradise similar to the other two islands with lush rain forests, beaches, and ancient temples: as such, it's sometimes known as the Jungle Island.</p>

                <p>The island is usually depicted as a small piece of land with a big mountain in the center in which a big skull is carved in one of the sides. Within Skull Rock, a big waterfall comes down, creating a river that separates the jungle from Papu Papu's village, called Skull Rock Waterfall. The village itself is located in the east part of the island and is protected by two big wooden gates, which the natives patrol constantly.</p>
