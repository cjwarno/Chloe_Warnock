                <p>You can earn valuable Gems and Keys throughout your adventure.
                    Gems are awarded in the Stage Clear area by getting through an
                    entire level without losing one Crash and breaking open all of the
                    boxes. Keys are awarded in the Cortex Bonus Rounds. Gems and
                    Keys allow Crash to access secret areas that were not originally
                    open to him.
                    Bonus Rounds can be accessed by collecting tokens found inside
                    boxes. These tokens may feature the likenesses of Tawna, Dr. Neo
                    Cortex, or Dr. N. Brio. Once you have collected all 3 tokens, you will
                    be transported to a Bonus Round that features a ton of boxes and
                    Wumpa fruit. If you end up falling off the screen, do not worry you
                    will not lose a life, you simply will be transported back to the level
                    you started from.</p>
