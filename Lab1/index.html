        <h1>Hello, My Name Is Chloe!</h1>
        <p>I am a Digital Media Major and I am very excited about this class and learning about and how to code. I am in my sophomore year of college and have enjoyed pretty much all of what I have learned and done in school. I enjoy doing make-up, making music, and writing. I wish to use my degree to pursue a career in music or television production.</p>
