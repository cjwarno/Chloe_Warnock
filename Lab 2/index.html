        <h4>My Favorite Gaming Consoles</h4>
    
        <p>I have played video games for as long as I can remember. My family had multiple consoles when I was growing up from a Nintendo 64 to Game Cubes and gaming PCs.</p>
    
        <p>My favorite game to play was Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and the older I got, I got into Sonic Adventure 2 and PC games like World of Warcraft. </p>
